# Jekyll Pure Liquid Fancy Tables

GitHub Pages only allows a specific set of plugins to run, hence, additional plugins like [jeffreytse/jekyll-spaceschip](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-spaceship) cannot work.

Inspired by that plugin, and the approach used in [allejo/jekyll-toc](https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-toc), I wanted to add support for fancy tables in Pure Liquid.

Benefits:

* Fully compatible with GitHub Pages
* Easily customisable to your needs
